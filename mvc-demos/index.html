			<li><sup>1</sup> Officially permits Zepto in place of jQuery; however, some features fail with it.</li>
			<li><sup>2</sup> Handlebars comes packaged with Ember, so does not require a separate include or allow alternatives.</li>
			<li><sup>3</sup> "Re-render" refers to throwing away dirty DOM and rebuilding from template, versus updating existing view nodes.</li>

		<h1>Commentary</h1>
		
		<h2>Angular</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Meticulous MVC pattern with focus on automation. Models auto-generate, views auto-bind, controllers are minimalist.</li>
			<li>Bigger and more enterprise-feeling framework. Lots of docs to read through, making it slower to start with.</li>
			<li>Seems to do a stupid amount of view processing. All view bindings update with every model change?</li>
			<li>Self-contained; includes everything from DOM management to Ajax services and routing.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Backbone</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Features an elegant model system with native REST services and built-in routing.</li>
			<li>Small framework with clean and concise documentation. Fast to look over and start using.</li>
			<li>Odd MV* pattern. Provides Model, Collection, and View, with amorphous relationship between components. Bad or good?.</li>
			<li>Brute-force approach to views: regenerates dirty DOM from script templates.</li>
			<li>Feels cluttered with dependencies.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Ember</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Enterprise-level framework that tries to do everything, and turns into a mess.</li>
			<li>Larger framework, or so it seems it with its long-winded and obtuse documentation. Slow to start with.</li>
			<li>Attempts to solve a lot of the same problems as Angular and Knockout, but with less elegance.</li>
			<li>BUTT-UGLY data binding. Renders script templates that will kick puppy dogs and make your mother cry.</li>
			<li>Bulky framework who's features don't match its girth IMHO: 140kb + jQuery?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Knockout</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Features a simple declarative data binding system for controlling complex views.</li>
			<li>Framework is small and simple, yet packs some serious black magic features. Interactive tutorials provide a quick start.</li>
			<li>Doesn't provide much beyond view controllers. Write your own data services.</li>
			<li>Great for small, view-heavy apps with modest data requirements.</li>
			<li>Light-weight, no dependencies, and fun to use. Definitely "knocks stuff out" quickly.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Spine</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Very similar to Backbone. Great model system, native REST and routing.</li>
			<li>Nice simplification of Models and Controllers from Backbone. Much more concise component relationships.</li>
			<li>Documentation is long-winded in a mix of JS and CoffeeScript. Not as clean and easy to pick up as Backbone.</li>
			<li>Takes the same brute-force approach for regenerating dirty views from template as Backbone.</li>
			<li>Fragmented into components, making it potentially lighter, but more confusing to configure.</li>
		</ul>
